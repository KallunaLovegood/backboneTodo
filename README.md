backboneTodo
============

A quick todo app I followed a tutorial for here --> http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2012/09/11/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/

If you're just getting started with backbone like I am, I definitely recommend following through his stuff. Really simple, and he keeps everything in one file so you don't have to worry about how everything connects just yet - you can get away with just trying to understand the basics. I even did styles in the index.html, so feel free to take a look.

I'll be adding more stuff in here soon.

Cheers,
Heather
